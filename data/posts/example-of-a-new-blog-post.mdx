# Let's find out to add a new blog post to this website.

## Sync local and remote

```java
git pull origin main
```

## Digitalocean instructions

Using info from this page: [How To Create a Pull Request on GitHub](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)

Now, we’ll create our new branch with the git branch command. Make sure you name it descriptively so that others working on the project understand what you are working on.

```java
git branch new-branch
```

Now that our new branch is created, we can switch to make sure that we are working on that branch by using the git checkout command:

```java
git checkout new-branch
```

Once you enter the git checkout command, you will receive the following output:

Output

```java
Switched to branch 'new-branch'
```

Alternatively, you can condense the above two commands, creating and switching to a new branch, with the following command and -b flag:

```java
git checkout -b new-branch
```

If you want to switch back to main, you’ll use the checkout command with the name of the main branch:

```java
git checkout main
```

The checkout command will allow you to switch between multiple branches, so you can potentially work on multiple features at once.

## Create a branch

```java
git branch new-blog-post-branch
```

## Use the branch

```java
git checkout new-blog-post-branch
```

## or combine the two commands

```java
git checkout -b new-blog-post-branch
```

## create a blog post in `data/posts`

created (this) file `example-of-a-new-post.mdx`

## add an entry to the `data/data.ts`

File `data/data.ts`

```java
export const newContent = [
  {
    link: '/blog/example-of-a-new-blog-post',
    text: 'Example of how to create a new blog post on this website',
    showNewTag: true
  },
```

## add the content to git

```java
git add .
git commit -m "example-of-a-new-blog-post"
git status
```

## Push Changes

Once you have saved and exited the commit message text file, you can verify what Git will be committing with the following command:

```java
git status
```

Depending on the changes that you have made, you will receive output that resembles this:

Output

```java
On branch new-branch
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

```java
git push --set-upstream origin new-blog-post-branch
```

The command will provide you with output to let you know of the progress, and it will be similar to the following:

Output

```java
Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 336 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
   a1f29a6..79c0e80  new-branch  -> new-branch
Branch new-branch set up to track remote branch new-branch from origin.
```

You can now navigate to the forked repository on your GitHub webpage and toggle to the branch you pushed to see the changes you have made in-browser.

At this point, it is possible to make a pull request to the original repository, but if you have not already done so, you’ll want to make sure that your local repository is up-to-date with the upstream repository.

## The new blog post will appear in three places

1. New Content on the front page middle-of-the-page card "New year, new content"

2. The blog post will be listed in the Blog page

3. Pull Requests in the Links-->Changelog
