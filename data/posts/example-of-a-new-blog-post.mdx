# Let's find out to add a new blog post to this website.

## Sync local and remote

```java
git pull origin main
```

## Digitalocean instructions

Using info from this page: [How To Create a Pull Request on GitHub](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)

Now, we’ll create our new branch with the git branch command. Make sure you name it descriptively so that others working on the project understand what you are working on.

```java
git branch new-branch
```

Now that our new branch is created, we can switch to make sure that we are working on that branch by using the git checkout command:

```java
git checkout new-branch
```

Once you enter the git checkout command, you will receive the following output:

Output

```java
Switched to branch 'new-branch'
```

Alternatively, you can condense the above two commands, creating and switching to a new branch, with the following command and -b flag:

```java
git checkout -b new-branch
```

If you want to switch back to main, you’ll use the checkout command with the name of the main branch:

```java
git checkout main
```

The checkout command will allow you to switch between multiple branches, so you can potentially work on multiple features at once.

## Create a branch

```java
git branch new-blog-post-branch
```

## Use the branch

```java
git checkout new-blog-post-branch
```

## or combine the two commands

```java
git checkout -b new-blog-post-branch
```

## create a blog post in `data/posts`

created (this) file `example-of-a-new-post.mdx`

## add an entry to the `data/data.ts`

File `data/data.ts`

```java
export const newContent = [
  {
    link: '/blog/example-of-a-new-blog-post',
    text: 'Example of how to create a new blog post on this website',
    showNewTag: true
  },
```

## add the content to git

```java
git add .
git commit -m "example-of-a-new-blog-post"
git status
```

## The new blog post will appear in three places

1. New Content on the front page middle-of-the-page card "New year, new content"

2. The blog post will be listed in the Blog page

3. Pull Requests in the Links-->Changelog
